MP2RAGE is a T1 weighted MRI sequence that estimates a composite image providing much reduction of the receiver bias, has a high intensity dynamic range, and provides an estimate of T1 mapping. It is, therefore, an appealing option for brain morphometry studies. However, previous studies have reported a difference in cortical thickness computed from MP2RAGE compared with widely used Multi-Echo MPRAGE. In this article, we demonstrated that using standard segmentation and partial volume estimation techniques on MP2RAGE introduces systematic errors, and we proposed a new model to estimate partial volume of the cortical gray matter. We also included in their model a local estimate of tissue intensity to take into account the natural variation of tissue intensity across the
brain. A theoretical framework is provided and validated using synthetic and physical phantoms. A repeatability experiment comparing MPRAGE and MP2RAGE confirmed that MP2RAGE using our model could be considered for structural imaging in brain morphology study, with similar cortical thickness estimate than that computed with MPRAGE.
