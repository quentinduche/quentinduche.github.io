Neurofeedback (NF), an advanced technique enabling self-regulation of brain activity, was used to enhance upper limb motor recovery in chronic stroke survivors. A comparison was conducted between the efcacy of NF versus motor imagery (MI) training without feedback. We hypothesized that employing a bimodal EEG-fMRI based NF training approach would ensure precise targeting, and incorporating progressive multi-target feedback would provide a more efective mean to enhance plasticity. Thirty stroke survivors, exhibiting partial upper-limb motor impairment with a Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity score (FMA-UE)>21 and partially functional corticospinal tract (CST) were randomly allocated to the NF and MI groups. The NF group (n=15) underwent a bimodal EEG-fMRI NF training focused on regulating activity in ipsilesional motor areas (M1 and SMA), while the MI group (n=15) engaged in MI training. Demographic and stroke clinical data were collected. The primary outcome measure was the post-intervention FMA-UE score. Change in bold activations in target regions, EEG and fMRI laterality index (LI) and fractional anisotropy (FA) asymmetry of the CST were assessed after the intervention in both groups (respectively ΔEEG LI, ΔMRI LI and ΔFA asymmetry) and correlated with FMA-UE improvement (ΔFMA). Participants from both groups completed the 5-week training, with the NF group successfully modulating their brain activity in target regions. FMA-UE improvement post-intervention tended to be higher in the NF group than in the MI group (p=0.048), and FMA-UE increased signifcantly only in the NF group (p=0.003 vs p=0.633 for MI). This improvement persisted at one-month in the NF group (p=0.029). Eight out 15 patients in the NF group positively responded (i.e., improved by at least for 4 points in FMA-UE) compared to 3 out 15 in the MI group. No signifcant between-group diferences were found in the evolution of ipsilesional M1 (t=1.43, p=0.16) and SMA (t=0.85, p=0.40) activation maps. The NF group exhibited a more pronounced lateralisation in unimodal EEG LI (t=− 3.56, p=0.0004) compared to the MI group, but no signifcant diference was observed for MRI LI. A non-signifcant diference in ΔFA asymmetry of the CST between the two groups was found (t=25; p=0,055). A non-signifcant correlation between unimodal ΔEEG LI and ΔFMA (r=0.5; p=0.058) was observed for the NF group. Chronic stroke survivors can efectively engage themselves in a NF task and can beneft from a bimodal EEG-fMRI NF training. This demonstrates potential for NF in enhancing upper-limb motor recovery more efciently than MI training.
