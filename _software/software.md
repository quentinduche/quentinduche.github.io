I am involved in the development of several Empenn projects regarding data management and image processing tools.

# Shanoir Downloader
- Keywords: Medical imaging, Data management, Big data, Python 
- Description: Shanoir Downloader enables large volumes of imaging data stored on the Shanoir software platform to be downloaded via a python interface. Data can be retrieved in DICOM or NIFTI formats. The integrity of downloaded data is verified. Shanoir Downloader also enables downloaded data to be pseudonymised and organised according to the BIDS standard.

# automri
- Description: This software is highly configurable in order to fit a wide range of needs. Preprocessing includes segmentation of anatomical data, as well as co-registration, spatial normalization and atlas building of all data types. The analysis pipelines perform either within-group analysis or between-group or one subject-versus-group comparison, and produce statistical maps of regions with significant differences. These pipelines can be applied to structural data to exhibit patterns of atrophy or lesions, to ASL (both pulsed or pseudo-continuous sequences) data to detect perfusion abnormalities, to functional data - either BOLD or ASL - to outline brain activations related to block or event-related paradigms. New functionalities have been implemented to facilitate the management and processing of data coming from complex projects.

# pyautomri
- Description : `pyautomri` is a python project providing tools for processing 1st level fMRI results and reporting/plotting group level analyses. It is mainly (but not exclusively) designed to match automri (MATLAB package) BOLD projects.
